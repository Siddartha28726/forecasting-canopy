This is an advanced flood prediction and disaster management system that leverages machine learning and
 environmental data to forecast flood risks across regions. By utilizing the Random Forest algorithm, identifies
 f
 lood-prone areas, assessing environmental variables like rainfall, humidity, temperature, and seasonal weather
 patterns. This high precision in flood forecasting allows for proactive interventions, providing disaster
 management teams with critical information to mobilize resources effectively, initiate early evacuations, and
 reduce the impact of floods on vulnerable communities.
